          <h5>Why Study Tafseer?</h5>
          <p>
            The Quran is not just a book of recitation; it is a complete guide
            to living a fulfilling and purposeful life. However, without
            understanding the meanings of its verses, it is difficult to fully
            apply its teachings. Tafseer helps you unlock the wisdom embedded in
            every verse, making the Quran a living guide in your life.
