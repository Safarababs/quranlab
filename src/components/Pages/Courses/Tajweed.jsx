          <p>
            The <strong>Tajweed (Quranic Pronunciation)</strong> course is
            dedicated to teaching you the correct way to pronounce the Arabic
            letters and words in the Quran. The word "Tajweed" comes from the
            Arabic root word "jayyid," meaning to improve or to make better.
            This course ensures that every Muslim recites the Quran in the most
            beautiful and accurate way, adhering to the rules of Tajweed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tajweed is not just about recitation; it is an essential aspect of
            preserving the Quran’s integrity as it was revealed. Incorrect
            pronunciation of letters or words can change the meaning of the
            verses. Therefore, mastering Tajweed is crucial to ensuring the
            words of Allah are recited correctly.
          </p>
          <h5>Course Content:</h5>
          <p>
            This course will guide you through the fundamental rules of Tajweed,
            making it easy for you to learn and implement in your recitation.
            The following key topics will be covered:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Articulation Points (Makhaarij):</strong> Learn the
              correct points of articulation for each Arabic letter. Properly
              articulating each letter ensures that the Quran is recited with
              precision.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Nasal Sounds (Ghunna):</strong> Understand the proper
              rules of nasal sounds, such as those found in letters like "ن"
              (noon) and "م" (meem). This part of Tajweed adds a special melody
              to the recitation of the Quran.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Elongation (Madd):</strong> Master the rules of
              elongation, which determine how long to stretch certain vowels
              during recitation. This rule is vital in maintaining the rhythm
              and flow of Quranic verses.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Idghaam, Ikhfaa, and Iqlaab:</strong> Learn the rules
              regarding the merging of sounds (Idghaam), the hiding of letters
              (Ikhfaa), and the transformation of one letter into another
              (Iqlaab).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Stopping and Pausing (Waquf and Sakt):</strong> Understand
              the rules for stopping at the correct places in a verse and how
              pausing can impact the meaning and beauty of the recitation.
            </li>
          </ul>
